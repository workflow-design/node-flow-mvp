## Decisions

### [Date TBD] — Project Initialized

**Decision:** Start with Next.js 14 App Router, React Flow, Fal.ai, Tailwind, deployed on Vercel.

**Context:** Need a simple stack to build a workflow canvas MVP.

**Rationale:** 
- Next.js App Router is the modern default
- React Flow is the standard for node-based UIs
- Fal.ai provides simple API access to multiple models
- Tailwind is fast for prototyping
- Vercel is zero-config for Next.js

**Consequences:** Locked into these choices for MVP. Can revisit post-MVP if needed.
